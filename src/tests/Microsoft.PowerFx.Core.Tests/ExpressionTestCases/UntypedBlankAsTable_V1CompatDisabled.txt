// Consider an untyped blank, such as the return type from Blank(), as an argument to a single column table enabled function.
//
// We favor treating these as a scalar blank, rather than a table blank.  Scalar is the simpler form and more likely
// what the maker wanted.  This treatment is also consistent with Canvas.
//
// A typed Blank, such as returned from a database or If(1<0,"foo") is fine, it specifically an untyped Blank that is odd.
//
// In general, a function that takes a blank table argument will return a blank table.
