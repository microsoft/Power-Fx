    /// Transport code generation generates proxies, dto types, and converters for any type annotated with this attribute.
    /// Transport enabled methods and properties may only use supported transport types.
    /// 
    /// There are 3 kinds of annotated transport types:
    /// - ByValue (default). The public properties of this type are copied on the wire to the client, which receives
    ///     its own copy of the object.
    /// - ServerRemoted. A reference to an instance is stored in the IdKeeper for the ConnectionState, and its ID in that table
    ///     is sent on the wire. The client receives a proxy object with the transport enabled properties and methods on this type.
    ///     Method calls have their arguments converted into wire format, sent to the server, executed, and the result serialized on
    ///     the wire and returned. The return type is converted into a promise if it isn't already. Properties on the server object
    ///     are sent by value to the client, and updated after most remoted method calls.
    /// - Custom. The user specifies a class that provides dto conversion methods for this type. The wire format for the object is 
    ///     determined by the dto type that the user choses. This is intended to be used as part of migration from existing proxies.
    ///
