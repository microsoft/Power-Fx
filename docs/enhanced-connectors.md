# Overview
Enhanced connectors allow Power Platform to connect to tabular data in external datasources. Whereas action connectors allow invoking a fixed list of operations calls described via OpenApi("swagger"), Enhanced connectors need to describe a dynamic set of tables, schemas and capabilities. 

This describes the Enhanced connector Protocol. This protocol is a RESTful protocol primarily based on OData and augmented with metadata to be self-describing. 

The protocol is stateless and "pass through" - no indices are created. Clients (such as Power Apps) call into the connector via Odata, and then the connector transforms that to an outgoing request to the underlying datasource.  When used with Power Platform, the Connector infrastructure will stamp the auth token that was provided when the connection was created. 

So essentially, an enhanced connector has several key parts:
1. Metadata: ability to describe the metadata of the target datasources 
2. The Transpiler: ability to accept an OData request and execute it against the target datasource. This is for Read operations. 
3. Create, Update, Delete operations.

## Concepts 
Tabular data follows the following resource hierarchy: 

- A `dataset` exposes a collection of tables 
- A `table` has `rows` and `columns` that contain data 
- An `item` represents a row of a table 

This means the tables are exposed in a 2-tier namespace (dataset / table). 

Examples:
| Connector | Dataset | Table |
|--|--|--|
| SQL | Database | Table |
| SharePoint | Site | List |

Tables are queried using a subset of `OData queries`, notably $filter, $select, $orderby, $sort, and $top. A key principle of Power Platform is to enable good design-time experiences. 
This means that the protocol is self-describing with rich metadata endpoints. The connector must describe which queries it can support at design time - prior to executing the query. 

`Capabilities` refers to metadata describing what query operations are supported. 

For example, a UI may only allow filtering on columns that are marked filterable; or it may only show sort icons on columns that can be sorted. 

`Transpiler` refers to converting from the incoming odata query to the datasource's native format.  For example, the SQL connector takes in odata queries and converts them to outgoing SQL statements. Connectors effectively must implement a query tree transformation. 

Tables and Columns may have both:
- `Logical Names` which are used in the API. This could be a guid or mangled form of the display name. Logical names are api-friendly and just alpahnumeric characeters.
- `Display Names` which are shown to the user and can include any characters (including spaces, and special characters).


A connector is primarily  means having a `transpiler` that takes in an incoming OData request and converts it to the outgoing 

## Power Fx and Delegation 

Power Fx expressions provide an easy way to access Enhanced connectors.  `Delegation` refers to translating a Power Fx function into an efficieint server-side operation. The Power Fx engine will look at the connector capabilities and produce a query. 

Power Fx will also present Display Names in the expressions but translate to logical names for the queries. 

For example, 
- if `MyTable` is a connection with dataset="default" and tableName="myTable512", 
- and it has columns with display names Score and Age, and logical names new_score, new_age respectively
- then that table capabilities suports filter and sort, then this expression:

`Sort(Filter(MyTable, Score > 100), Age)`

Would get executed as a single query to the connector:

`GET /datasets/default/tables/myTable512/items?$filter=new_score+gt+100&$sort=new_age`

Power Fx may also do column analysis and add a $select clause. 

For operations that can't be delegated, Power Fx can  detect this statically via the metadata nd issue a warning. The host then has the option to fallback to downloading the rows and doing client-side execution. This is effective for small tables.

# REST API 
This section describes the REST endpoints the connector needs to implement. 
APIs are restful and return JSON results.

The endpoints should use these status codes:
- 200: success
- 401: unauthorized request
- 404: item not found


Errors should follow a standard payload:
```
{
    "message" : "here's a message",
    "RequestUri" : "/"
}
```

## Auth 
An enhanced connector is "pass through". The connector will receive an auth token that was setup when the connection was created.  This could be an api key or auth token to the target datasource.   It could also be a property bag (like a base64 encoded JSON object) that contains multiple properties like an API Endpoint and API key for accessing the target data. 


## Table Metadata

### GET /datasets
Enumerates the data sets in the connector. 
Often, this just returns a single dataset named `default`. 


### GET /$metadata.json/datasets
Get connector-wide  metadata for the dataset.

Sample 200 response:
```
{
  "tabular": {
    "source": "mru",
    "displayName": "site",
    "urlEncoding": "double",
    "tableDisplayName": "list",
    "tablePluralName": "lists"
  },
  "blob": {
    "source": "mru",
    "displayName": "site",
    "urlEncoding": "double"
  }
}
```

### GET /datasets/{datasetName}/tables
Enumerate the tables in the dataset. 

Returns an array of tableName and DisplayName pairs. The tableName is the logical name that can be used elsewhere in this API.  The DisplayName is suitable to show the user.

Sample 200 response:
```
{
  "value": [
    {
      "Name": "4bd37916-0026-4726-94e8-5a0cbc8e476a",
      "DisplayName": "Documents"
    },
    {
      "Name": "5266fcd9-45ef-4b8f-8014-5d5c397db6f0",
      "DisplayName": "MyTestList"
    }
  ]
}
```


### GET /$metadata.json/datasets/{datasetName}/tables/{tableName}
Get metdata for a specific table. This includes:
- table capabilities 
- column information

### Capabilities

Capabilities are used for query delegation
As an example `First(table)`, without delegation, will make the server retrieve all rows (or first page of, for example, 1000 rows), then return only 1 row
With delegation enabled, we'll be able to send "GetItems" request with "$top=1" command to have the server only return 1 row.

Capabilities are defined in `x-ms-capabilities` extension.
Capabilities are categorized in 2 parts: table level capabilities and column level capabilities.

## Runtime CRUD operations 


### Etags

Enhanced connectors use optimistic concurrency via an etag pattern. 
In PATCH, DELETE, POST requests, `If-Match` header can be used
In POST, GET requests, `If-None-Match` header can be used
Responses may contain `ETag` header

Return a 412 status code in etag mismatch. 

### POST /datasets/{datasetName}/tables/{tableName}/items
Create a new row. 

### GET /datasets/{datasetName}/tables/{tableName}/items

OData optional parameters (in query string)
- $filter
- $orderby
- $skip
- $top
- $select
- $count

The supported runtime operations here should be consistent with the capabilities described in the metadata.
